// ****************************************************************************
// A small C program to create DIMACS CNF files that encode the pigeonhole
// problem (i.e. placing n+1 pigeons into n holes).
//
// The SAT encoding of this problem is very straightforward.
// The variables can be ordered in either pigeon-major or hole-major order
//
// For each pigeon i and each hole j we have a variable x_{n*(i-1)+j}
// (pigeon-major) or x_{n*(j-1)+i} (hole-major) which means that
// pigeon i is placed in hole j.  Then we have n+1 clauses which say
// that a pigeon has to be placed in some hole.  Then for each hole we
// have a set of clauses ensuring that only one single pigeon is
// placed into that hole.
//
// This encoding leads to a total of (n+1) * n propositional variables and
// (n+1) + n * (n * (n+1) / 2) clauses.
//
// The resulting SAT problem is unsatisfiable.
