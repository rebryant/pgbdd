Observations on reading the code.  Randal E. Bryant

The code uses an adjacency-list representation of a bipartite graph.  Maximum degree = 7.

"Arete" is French for "edge"

The command-line argument p must range between 25 and 75.  It designates
the percentage of nodes that are assigned polarity 1.
