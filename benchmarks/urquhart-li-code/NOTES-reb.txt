Observations on reading the code.  Randal E. Bryant

The code uses an adjacency-list representation of a bipartite graph.  Maximum degree = 7.

"Arete" is French for "edge"

The command-line argument p must range between 25 and 75.  It designates
the percentage of nodes that are assigned polarity 1.

The generator is used in the paper li, Chu-Min, "Equivalent literal
propagation in the DLL procedure", Discrete Applied Mathematics 130
(2003) 251--276.

It describes two different variants.  It's unclear which one this code
generates.

File name cannot contain '-r', or it will confuse this with the commandline switch -r
