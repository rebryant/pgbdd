Notes on Simon's Urquhart benchmark generator

12 June 2020.  Randal E. Bryant

noeud = node data structure.  Includes adjacency lists

Has three lists:

link

linktoens

numlink: Appears to be IDs of edge variables

Global array noeuds = 2 X n nodes to represent bipartite graph

In main, uses m to represent what is usually n

Main:

First phase.
  For i in {0..m-1}:
    Choose unused value ouDansPioche.
      Based on random choice among remaining unused values
    Mark as used in array apiocher
    Create edge from i to ouDansPioche
  (Effect: generate random permutation for first set of edges)

Second phase.
   Randomly choose remaining degree for vertex
   Find random assignment of neighbors to reach this degree,
     without any duplications and without going beyond
     maximum degree of other vertices

Third phase.
   Add side edges
