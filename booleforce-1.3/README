This is the 'booleforce' SAT solver.

To compile the solver, run './configure' first and then issue 'make'.  This
should build an optimized version of the solver 'booleforce' and the trace
checker 'tracecheck'.  Further options to './configure', which for instance
allow 'proof generation' or debugging, are described in the command line
option summary of configure which can be obtained by './configure -h'.  

For usage of the solver as a library consider the API described in
'booleforce.h'.   Only the library 'libbooleforce.a' needs to be linked.
