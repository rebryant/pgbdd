1. Encoding int into binary form

The first step of the binary encoding is mapping literals in the
DIMACS format to unsigned integers. The following mapping function is
used: map(l) := (l > 0)? 2*l : -2*l + 1. The mapping for some DIMACS
literals are shown below.

     DIMACS literals   unsigned integers
						  
		 -63     127
		 129     258   
	       -8191   16383
	       -8193   16387
	


Variable-Byte Encoding of Unsigned Integers

Assume that 'w0, ..., wi' are 7-bit words, 'w1' to 'wi' all non zero
and the unsigned number 'x' can be represented as

    x = w0 + 2^7*w1 + 2^14*w2 + 2^(7*i)*wi


The variable-byte encoding of DRAT (also used in AIGER) is the
sequence of i bytes b0, ... bi:

    1w0, 1w1, 1w2, ..., 0wi 


The MSB of a byte in this sequence signals whether this byte is the
last byte in the sequence, or whether there are still more bytes to
follow. Here are some examples:

	           x               b0 b1 b2 b3 b4
						  
		   0   		   00
		   1               01
		2^7-1    =   127   7f
		2^7      =   128   80 01
		2^8  + 2 =   258   82 02
		2^14 - 1 = 16383   ff 7f
		2^14 + 3 = 16387   83 80 01
		2^28 - 1           ff ff ff 7f
		2^28 + 7           87 80 80 80 01
	

2. Encoding CNF into binary form

The usual header "p cnf vars clauses" is encoded as the binary
encodings of the integers 'p', vars, clauses 0.

Clauses are encoded in the standard form

3. Encoding proof into binary form

Lines of the form S l1 ... lm 0 a1 ... an 0
are encoded as the binary encodings of S 'a' l1 ... lm 0 a1 ... an 0

Lines of the form S d c1 ... cm 0
are encoded as the binary encodings of S 'd' c1 ... cm 0
